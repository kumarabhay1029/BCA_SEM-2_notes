## üèóÔ∏è 1. What is Computer Architecture? 

Computer architecture is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.  
It defines how a computer's hardware and software interact and how instructions are executed.

**Key components:**
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brain of the computer.
- **Memory:** Stores data and instructions.
- **Input/Output (I/O) Devices:** Devices that interact with the outside world.

## üèõÔ∏è 2. Main Computer Architectures

### 2.1 Von Neumann Architecture

- **Single memory** for both data and instructions.
- **One bus** for transfers between memory and CPU.
- **Sequential execution**: Fetches one instruction or data at a time.
- **Von Neumann Bottleneck**: Cannot fetch data and instruction simultaneously, leading to slowdowns.

**Diagram:**
```
+---------------------+
|      Memory         |  <-- Both instructions & data
+---------------------+
         |
         v
+---------------------+
|        CPU          |
+---------------------+
         |
         v
+---------------------+
|   Input/Output      |
+---------------------+
```

**Examples:**  
- Most PCs and laptops (Intel, AMD processors)
- General-purpose computers

### 2.2 Harvard Architecture

- **Separate memories** for instructions and data.
- **Two buses**: Allows simultaneous fetch of instruction and data.
- **Faster execution** due to no bottleneck.

**Diagram:**
```
+-------------------+       +------------------+
| Instruction Memory| <---> |   CPU            |
+-------------------+       +------------------+
                                  ^
                                  |
+-------------------+       +------------------+
|     Data Memory   | <---> |   CPU            |
+-------------------+       +------------------+
```

**Examples:**  
- Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino Uno, PIC, AVR)
- Digital Signal Processors (DSPs)
- Embedded systems (washing machines, microwave controllers)

---

### 2.3 CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)

- **Large and complex instruction set**: Each instruction can perform multiple operations.
- **Easier for programmers** as instructions are close to high-level language statements.
- **Slower decoding** due to complexity.

**Examples:**  
- Intel x86 processors (most desktop and laptop CPUs)

---

### 2.4 RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)

- **Small, simple instruction set:** Each instruction does only one operation.
- **Easier to pipeline and often faster**.
- **Requires more instructions** for complex tasks, but each instruction executes quickly.

**Examples:**  
- ARM processors (used in most smartphones)
- MIPS processors

---

### 2.5 Multiprocessor & Mobile Architectures

- **Multiprocessor:** Multiple CPUs working together for higher performance (servers, supercomputers).
- **Mobile Architectures:** Optimized for power efficiency (e.g., ARM Cortex in smartphones).
